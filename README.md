Johns Hopkins Coursera
Module 4 coding assignment 
HTML, CSS and Javascript for Web developers

Instructor : Yaakov Chaikin

Lessons brief: Include functionality to a website for fun. In this module, the fundamentals of the Javascript language are taught. One is  empowered by the Javascript language features, not confused by them. Just about everything is covered - from common language constructs and Javascript types to objects, functions, arrays, closures, and scope isolation.

Number of lessons: 12
Number of practice quiz: 9

> Summary : Loop over an array of names and print out either a hello or goodbye in front of that name in the browser console. If the name starts with a letter j or J, you are to print out Goodbye JSomeName. If the name starts with any other letter, you are to print out Hello SomeName.
However, in order to print it out, one uses 2 externally provided libraries whose code is not 100% ready to be used. Using the things we've learned in the module, job will be to fix the code in those libraries.

> Features learnt : Arrays, fake namespaces, immediately invoked function expressions(IIFEs), development environment for Javascript development, define variables, function, scope, javascript types, common language constructs, default values, creating objects using new object() syntax, passing variables by value vs. by reference, function constructors, prototype, object literals. 

Used : HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

### Some Assignment requirements: 
```sh
1. When working on the assignment, use Browser Sync and keep Chrome open to the Console tab of the Chrome Developer Tools. There will appear errors to start with. Follow the steps outlined in the starter code and those errors should go away by the time the last step is done. If errors are seen at that point or not seeing the relevant output, a mistake is probably made somewhere, so look into that and investigate. 
2. Review other student's assignments and mark accordingly to rubric given. 
•	Open chrome developer tools and use console tab. 
•	Check the output to see if the assignment is done correctly. 
•	Using sources tab, look for the file 'script.js' , and investigate that the code does not look like someone simply call console.log manually on each name. 
•	see calls to objects in script.
